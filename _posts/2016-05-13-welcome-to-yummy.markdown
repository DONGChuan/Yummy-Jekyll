It was with much hesitation and very little by way of expectation that I decided to read 'Haunted Empire, Apple after Steve Jobs'. I had read a number of reviews that tore the book to shreds and cited it as a work of fiction and far removed from the actual facts and events surrounding Apple. However I decided that I would give the book a try and be as open minded as possible and not let the views of others cloud my own judgement of the book. 

It was my first time listening to a book rather than reading it but I chose to get it from Audible as my time was restrictive and I thought it would be quicker to listen instead of reading. It also allowed me to listen to the book at times when reading it might have been impossible. 

Yukari Iwatani Kane starts off by talking about the events that happened after Steve Jobs rejoined Apple as CEO in 1997 covering the iPod, iPhone, iPad and other products released under the reign of Steve Jobs. She describes the manor in which Steve ran the company and painted Steve as an innovator and visionary that brought Apple back from the brink of Bankruptcy. Whilst most of what she says is correct there are many things left out possibly by accident or purposely whitewashed over. 

Touching on the death of Apples visionary was very moving and did make me shed a little tear much like I did the night that I learned of the death of Steve Jobs. But it quickly became evident that the positive way in which Apple had been portrayed so far in this book were about to change. (Insert name) quickly turned the story around to Tim Cook and you could feel the positivity seeping away the more you read. Although the book does stick to the main facts surrounding Apple (Insert Name) draws her own conclusions and presents the facts in a biased manner. 

I would recommend that anyone considering reading this book think carefully before reading especially if your quite well educated on the goings on at Apple as you will undoubtedly be as frustrated as I was when the fatcs were distored and opinion triumphs over reality. I really enjoyed the book up until chaper 8-9 when for me it just fell apart and turned into an anti Apple, Anti Tim Cook review. That's all I have to say.
